# ROS directory and writing a node

## Make Directory

- make directory

```
makdir catkin_ws
```

to navigate to directory we use `cd` :

```
cd catkin_ws
```

> [!NOTE]
> use `ls` in directory to see the list.

> [!TIP]
> use `win + tab` to switch between terminal windows.

- run in terminal to make directory:
  similar to making in c++, it will make the file and check versions.  

  ```
  catkin_make
  ```
  
  - after making it, use `ls` in terminal. There should be 3 names like the picture bellow.
